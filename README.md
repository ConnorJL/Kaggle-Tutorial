# Kaggle-Tutorial
A small MLP made in PyTorch for demonstration at Kaggle Munich for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). The script has been fixed and annotated with comments, it should work now without problems. 

The requirements to run this script are PyTorch and Pandas.
